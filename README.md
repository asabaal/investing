# Improved Intraday Data Pull Implementation

This branch contains improvements to the app's intraday data pull functionality, especially for handling large amounts of data (like 24 months of intraday data).

## Key Changes

1. **Enhanced Rate Limit Handling**
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter for rate limit waits
   - Better detection of both per-minute and daily API limits
   - Visual animations during waiting periods

2. **Checkpoint System**
   - Automatic saving of progress during long data pulls
   - Resume capability after interruptions
   - Checkpoint saving every 3 months

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Visual status updates in sidebar
   - Detailed progress information
   - Data preview during fetching
   - Animated waiting indicators

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Multiple retries for API failures
   - Better status messages
   - Graceful recovery from interruptions

## Implementation Guide

The changes should be implemented in this order:

1. First import these changes to app.py:
   - Add missing imports (math, random)
   - Add animation CSS
   - Add fetch state tracking

2. Then integrate these functions:
   - Enhanced rate limit handling
   - Checkpoint saving/loading
   - Status sidebar rendering

3. Next, replace the fetch_multi_month_intraday function with the improved version

4. Finally, update the main UI integration points with the status elements

## How To Test

1. Choose "Multi-month historical data" in the intraday options
2. Select a reasonably large time frame (6+ months)
3. Observe how the app shows status during API rate limits
4. Try interrupting and resuming the operation
