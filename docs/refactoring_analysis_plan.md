# Refactoring Analysis Plan

## Approach to Incremental Refactoring

This document outlines how we'll approach the systematic refactoring of the Symphony Trading System codebase. Our goal is to implement improvements incrementally while maintaining functionality.

## Process

1. **Function Analysis**: Identify and catalog functions that need refactoring:
   - Functions longer than 20 lines
   - Functions with multiple levels of nesting
   - Functions that perform multiple responsibilities
   - Functions with complex or unclear logic

2. **Prioritization**: Rank functions to refactor based on:
   - Core functionality (most critical to system operation)
   - Complexity (most complex/difficult to understand)
   - Size (largest functions first)
   - Dependencies (functions with fewer dependencies first)

3. **Specification Creation**: For each function to refactor:
   - Create detailed specification using our template
   - Define function purpose, inputs, outputs
   - Outline test cases covering normal operation and edge cases

4. **Test Development**: Write tests before modifying code:
   - Create unit tests for current functionality
   - Ensure tests pass with current implementation
   - Use tests to verify behavior is preserved after refactoring

5. **Incremental Refactoring**:
   - Refactor one function at a time
   - Break complex functions into smaller, single-responsibility functions
   - Improve naming and documentation
   - Run tests after each change to verify functionality

6. **Review and Documentation**:
   - Document changes and design decisions
   - Update function docstrings
   - Update reference diagrams as needed

## Module Analysis Process

For each module, we'll follow this procedure:

1. Catalog all functions and their metrics:
   - Line count
   - Cyclomatic complexity (if measurable)
   - Number of parameters
   - Return value complexity

2. Identify high-priority functions using these criteria:
   - Lines of code > 15
   - Contains nested control structures (if-statements, loops) > 2 levels deep
   - Uses global state or has side effects
   - Lacks proper error handling
   - Performs multiple logical operations

3. Create function specifications for each high-priority function

4. Implement function-level tests

5. Refactor functions one by one

## Modules to Analyze (In Priority Order)

1. **composer_symphony.py**
   - Core module implementing Symphony class and related functionality
   - Contains complex logic for executing trading strategies

2. **prophet_forecasting.py**
   - Implements forecasting capabilities 
   - Integration with external libraries (Prophet)

3. **symphony_analyzer.py**
   - Analysis of symphony performance
   - Contains complex logic integrating multiple components

4. **alpha_vantage_api.py**
   - Core data acquisition module
   - Critical for reliable data access

5. **trading_system.py**
   - Main trading logic implementation
   - Core functionality for executing trades

6. **utils.py**
   - Utility functions used throughout the system
   - Potential for early wins with simple refactorings

## First Analysis: composer_symphony.py

We'll start by analyzing `composer_symphony.py` to identify functions that need refactoring. The first step will be to:

1. Count lines per function
2. Assess function complexity
3. Identify functions with multiple responsibilities
4. Document dependencies between functions
5. Create specifications for highest-priority functions

## Tracking Progress

We'll track our progress in the GitHub issue (#32) with updates as we complete each function refactoring. The progress will include:

- Functions analyzed
- Specifications created
- Tests implemented
- Functions refactored
- Improvements made (e.g., reduced line count, improved clarity)

## Code Quality Metrics

We'll track these metrics to measure improvement:

- Average function length (lines of code)
- Test coverage percentage
- Number of functions with clear docstrings
- Number of functions with tests
