# Symphony Trading System - Initial Refactoring Plan

## Project Structure

We've established the following structure for our refactoring effort:

1. **Development Branch**: `feature/modular-refactoring`
2. **Documentation Directory**: `docs/`
   - Templates and guidelines: `function_specification_template.md`, `refactoring_analysis_plan.md`
   - Diagrams: `diagrams/composer_symphony_class_diagram.md`
   - Function analysis: `function_analysis/symphony_execute.md`
3. **GitHub Issue**: #32 for tracking progress

## Assessment Summary

Our initial assessment revealed several areas for improvement:

1. **Function Length**: Many functions exceed recommended length (10-15 lines)
2. **Function Complexity**: Multiple nested control flows and conditional logic
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Functions often perform multiple tasks
4. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent handling of errors and edge cases
5. **Documentation**: Mixed quality of documentation
6. **Testing**: Minimal or no systematic testing

## Initial Focus: Symphony.execute()

We've chosen to start with the `Symphony.execute()` method because:

1. It's a core function in the system
2. It demonstrates several common issues (multiple responsibilities, minimal error handling)
3. Improvements here will make future refactoring easier
4. It's a critical path for system functionality

## Modularization Approach

Our plan for `Symphony.execute()` is to:

1. Extract the following methods:
   - `fetch_market_data()`: Responsible for getting required data
   - `apply_filters()`: Applies filters in sequence
   - `calculate_allocations()`: Handles allocation logic
   
2. Improve error handling and validation
   - Add proper error handling for API failures
   - Validate input parameters and data structures
   - Handle edge cases (empty universe, all symbols filtered out)

3. Refactor to use polymorphism rather than explicit type checking

## Testing Approach

We'll implement:

1. Unit tests for each extracted method
2. Integration tests for the full `execute()` method
3. Mocking of external dependencies (AlphaVantageClient)
4. Test cases for normal operation and edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Create unit tests for current `Symphony.execute()` behavior
2. Implement the extracted methods one by one with tests
3. Refactor `execute()` to use the new methods
4. Verify all tests pass and functionality is maintained
5. Move on to the next function for refactoring

## Future Targets

After completing `Symphony.execute()`, we'll focus on:

1. `SymphonyBacktester.backtest()`: Complex method with multiple responsibilities
2. Prophet forecasting integration: Fix issues with forecasting pipeline
3. Symphony parsing and validation: Improve error handling for malformed JSON

## Measuring Success

We'll track these metrics to measure improvement:

1. Reduction in average function length
2. Increase in test coverage
3. Improved error handling
4. Clearer function responsibilities
5. Better documentation

## Timeline

1. Initial setup and analysis: Complete
2. First function refactoring (Symphony.execute): In progress
3. Next functions: Pending completion of first refactoring

## Conclusion

This incremental approach allows us to:
- Make small, targeted improvements
- Maintain functionality throughout the process
- Systematically address technical debt
- Build a more maintainable and testable codebase
